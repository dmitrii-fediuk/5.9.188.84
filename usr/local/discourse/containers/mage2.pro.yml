params:
  ## Set db_shared_buffers to a max of 25% of the total memory.
  ## On 1GB installs set to 128MB (to leave room for other processes)
  ## on a 4GB instance you may raise to 1GB
  # 2018-01-23 "The default Discourse's `db_shared_buffers` value is 256Mb": https://discourse.pro/t/283
  db_shared_buffers: "1GB"
  ## Set higher on large instances it defaults to 10MB, for a 3GB install 40MB is a good default
  ## this improves sorting performance, but adds memory usage per-connection
