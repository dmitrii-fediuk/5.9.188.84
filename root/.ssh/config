	# 1) «Specifies whether keys should be automatically added to a running ssh-agent(1).
	# If this option is set to `yes` and a key is loaded from a file,
	# the key and its passphrase are added to the agent with the default lifetime, as if by ssh-add(1).
	# If this option is set to `ask`, ssh(1) will require confirmation using the SSH_ASKPASS program before adding a key
	# (see ssh-add(1) for details).
	# If this option is set to `confirm`, each use of the key must be confirmed, as if the -c option was specified to ssh-add(1).
	# If this option is set to `no`, no keys are added to the agent.
	# Alternately, this option may be specified as a time interval
	# using the format described in the TIME FORMATS section of sshd_config(5)
	# to specify the key's lifetime in ssh-agent(1), after which it will automatically be removed.
	# The argument must be `no` (the default), `yes`, `confirm` (optionally followed by a time interval), `ask`
	# or a time interval.»
