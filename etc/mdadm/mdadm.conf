# «The `ARRAY` lines identify actual arrays.
# The second word on the line may be the name of the device where the array is normally assembled,

# If the name does not start with a slash ('/'), it is treated as being in `/dev/md/`.
# Alternately the word `<ignore>` (complete with angle brackets) can be given

# If no device name is given, `mdadm` will use various heuristics to determine an appropriate name.
# Subsequent words identify the array, or identify the array as a member of a group.
# If multiple identities are given, then a component device must match ALL identities to be considered a match.
# Each identity word has a tag, and equals sign, and some value. The tags are:»
