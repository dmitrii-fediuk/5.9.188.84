# The `homehost` line gives a default value for the `--homehost=` option to `mdadm`.
# There should normally be only one other word on the line.
# It should either be a host name, or one of the special words `<system>`, `<none>` and `<ignore>`.
# *) If `<system>` is given, then the `gethostname(2)` systemcall is used to get the host name.
# This is the default.
# *) If `<ignore>` is given, then a flag is set
# so that when arrays are being auto-assembled the checking of the recorded homehost is disabled.
# If `<ignore>` is given it is also possible to give an explicit name which will be used when creating arrays.
# This is the only case when there can be more that one other word on the HOMEHOST line.
# *) If `<none>` is given, then the default of using `gethostname(2)` is over-ridden
# and no `homehost` name is assumed.
# When arrays are created, this host name will be stored in the metadata.
# When arrays are assembled using auto-assembly,
# arrays which do not record the correct homehost name in their metadata
# will be assembled using a "foreign" name.
# A "foreign" name alway ends with a digit string preceded by an underscore
# to differentiate it from any possible local name. e.g. `/dev/md/1_1` or `/dev/md/home_0`.

# The `mailaddr` line gives an E-mail address that alerts should be sent to
# when `mdadm` is running in `--monitor` mode (and was given the `--scan` option).
# There should only be one MAILADDR line and it should have only one address.

# «The `ARRAY` lines identify actual arrays.
# The second word on the line may be the name of the device where the array is normally assembled,
# such as `/dev/md1` or `/dev/md/backup`.
# If the name does not start with a slash ('/'), it is treated as being in `/dev/md/`.
# Alternately the word `<ignore>` (complete with angle brackets) can be given
# in which case any array which matches the rest of the line will never be automatically assembled.
# If no device name is given, `mdadm` will use various heuristics to determine an appropriate name.
# Subsequent words identify the array, or identify the array as a member of a group.
# If multiple identities are given, then a component device must match ALL identities to be considered a match.
# Each identity word has a tag, and equals sign, and some value. The tags are:»
