# «The `create` line gives default values to be used when creating arrays and device entries for arrays.
# These include:
# owner=
# group=
# 	These can give user/group ids or names to use instead of system defaults (`root`/`wheel` or `root`/`disk`).
# mode=
# 	An octal file mode such as 0660 can be given to override the default of 0600.
# auto=
# 	This corresponds to the `--auto` flag to `mdadm`.
# 	Give `yes`, `md`, `mdp`, `part` -- possibly followed by a number of partitions --
# 	to indicate how missing device entries should be created.
# metadata=
#	The name of the metadata format to use if none is explicitly given.
#	This can be useful to impose a system-wide default of version-1 superblocks.
# symlinks=no
# 	Normally when creating devices in `/dev/md/` `mdadm` will create a matching symlink
#	from `/dev/` with a name starting `md` or `md_`.
#	Give `symlinks=no` to suppress this symlink creation.»

# «The `homehost` line gives a default value for the `--homehost=` option to `mdadm`.
# There should normally be only one other word on the line.
# It should either be a host name, or one of the special words `<system>`, `<none>` and `<ignore>`.
# *) If `<system>` is given, then the `gethostname(2)` systemcall is used to get the host name.
# This is the default.
# *) If `<ignore>` is given, then a flag is set
# so that when arrays are being auto-assembled the checking of the recorded homehost is disabled.
# If `<ignore>` is given it is also possible to give an explicit name which will be used when creating arrays.
# This is the only case when there can be more that one other word on the HOMEHOST line.
# *) If `<none>` is given, then the default of using `gethostname(2)` is over-ridden
# and no `homehost` name is assumed.
# When arrays are created, this host name will be stored in the metadata.
# When arrays are assembled using auto-assembly,
# arrays which do not record the correct homehost name in their metadata
# will be assembled using a "foreign" name.
# A "foreign" name alway ends with a digit string preceded by an underscore
# to differentiate it from any possible local name. e.g. `/dev/md/1_1` or `/dev/md/home_0`.»

# «The `mailaddr` line gives an E-mail address that alerts should be sent to
# when `mdadm` is running in `--monitor` mode (and was given the `--scan` option).
# There should only be one MAILADDR line and it should have only one address.»

# «The `ARRAY` lines identify actual arrays.
# The second word on the line may be the name of the device where the array is normally assembled,
# such as `/dev/md1` or `/dev/md/backup`.
# If the name does not start with a slash ('/'), it is treated as being in `/dev/md/`.
# Alternately the word `<ignore>` (complete with angle brackets) can be given
# in which case any array which matches the rest of the line will never be automatically assembled.
# If no device name is given, `mdadm` will use various heuristics to determine an appropriate name.
# Subsequent words identify the array, or identify the array as a member of a group.
# If multiple identities are given, then a component device must match ALL identities to be considered a match.
# Each identity word has a tag, and equals sign, and some value. The tags are:
# uuid=
# 		The value should be a 128 bit uuid in hexadecimal, with punctuation interspersed if desired.
#		This must match the uuid stored in the superblock.
# name=
# 		The value should be a simple textual name as was given to `mdadm` when the array was created.
# 		This must match the name stored in the superblock on a device
#		for that device to be included in the array.
#		Not all superblock formats support names.
# super-minor=
#		The value is an integer which indicates the minor number that was stored in the superblock
#		when the array was created.
#		When an array is created as `/dev/mdX`, then the minor number X is stored.
# devices=
#		The value is a comma separated list of device names or device name patterns.
#		Only devices with names which match one entry in the list will be used to assemble the array.
#		Note that the devices listed there must also be listed on a DEVICE line.
# level=
#		The value is a raid level.
#		This is not normally used to identify an array, but is supported so that the output of
#		`mdadm --examine --scan` can be use directly in the configuration file.
# num-devices=
# 		The value is the number of devices in a complete active array.
#		As with `level=` this is mainly for compatibility with the output of `mdadm --examine --scan`.
# spares=
# 		The value is a number of spare devices to expect the array to have.
# 		The sole use of this keyword and value is as follows:
#		`mdadm --monitor` will report an array if it is found to have fewer than this number of spares
#		when `--monitor` starts or when `--oneshot` is used.
# spare-group=
#		The value is a textual name for a group of arrays.
#		All arrays with the same `spare-group` name are considered to be part of the same group.
#		The significance of a group of arrays is that `mdadm` will, when monitoring the arrays,
#		move a spare drive from one array in a group to another array in that group
#		if the first array had a failed or missing drive but no spare.
# auto=
# 		This option is rarely needed with mdadm-3.0,
#		particularly if use with the Linux kernel v2.6.28 or later.
#		It tells `mdadm` whether to use partitionable array or non-partitionable arrays
# 		and, in the absence of udev, how many partition devices to create.
#		From 2.6.28 all md array devices are partitionable, hence this option is not needed.
#		The value of this option can be "yes" or "md" to indicate that
# 		a traditional, non-partitionable `md` array should be created,
# 		or "mdp", "part" or "partition" to indicate that a partitionable `md` array
# 		(only available in linux 2.6 and later) should be used.
# 		This later set can also have a number appended
# 		to indicate how many partitions to create device files for, e.g. `auto=mdp5`.
# 		The default is 4.
# bitmap=
# 		The option specifies a file in which a write-intent bitmap should be found.
#		When assembling the array, `mdadm` will provide this file to the `md` driver as the bitmap file.
# 		This has the same function as the `--bitmap-file` option to `--assemble`.
# metadata=
# 		Specify the metadata format that the array has.
# 		This is mainly recognised for comparability with the output of `mdadm -Es`.
# container=
# 		Specify that this array is a member array of some container.
# 		The value given can be either a path name in `/dev`, or a UUID of the container array.
# member=
#		Specify that this array is a member array of some container.
#		Each type of container has some way to enumerate member arrays, often a simple sequence number.
# 		The value identifies which member of a container the array is.
# 		It will usually accompany a "container=" word.»
